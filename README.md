# CameraCalibration


Under development

this project is gonna effect whole camera distance measurement ways.

the idea is to find the fixpoint of camera where the view of the camera is one to one the real world.

we gonna take this value and calculate distance between objects (more spesific but under development so I am not gonna explain in detail)
